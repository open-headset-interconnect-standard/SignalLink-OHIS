# SignalLink-OHIS
An OHIS compliant config board for the SignalLink

<https://github.com/open-headset-interconnect-standard/ohis/issues/24>

The goal is to make a SignalLink compatible Plug &amp; Play Jumper module to turn a SignalLink computer/radio interface into a compliant OHIS User Adapter.  All the signals and connectors are there, it just needs the right connection pinout.  And that's what this project does.
